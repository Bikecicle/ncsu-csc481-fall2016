# Repository for work done in Game Engine Foundations (CSC481)

Coursework mainly involved designing and building a game engine ground-up in java over the length of the semester (/Engine) as well as demonstrating its capabilities and re-usability with two simple games (/Game1, /Game2). All assignments were strictly individual and completely open-ended in terms of design decisions and implementation.

# Features:
- Multiplayer client-server architecture
- Flexible world-object system
- Simple physics
- Multi-threading
- Simple scripting system with JavaScript
- High reusability

The games were still pretty buggy, but they work well enough to demonstrate ability to design and develop a large, complex system.

If you are feeling adventurous you can download and find the games in the /Executables folder.
